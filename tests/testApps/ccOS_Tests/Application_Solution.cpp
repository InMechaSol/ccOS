Notes:

Be certain to compile only one compilation unit in cpp,
 - not 1 in c and another in cpp
 - all three files (.h .c and .cpp)
 -- used to create single cpp compilation unit

This source demonstrates the usage of the ccNOos library and its dependence
on other files in the library.  A platform specific main(.c,.cpp) file need
only instantiate, configure, then execute the execution system.
